                    Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, full name Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was an eminent Indian scientist, engineer, and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, and passed away on July 27, 2015.
